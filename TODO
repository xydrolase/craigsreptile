TODO:
    - For posts with approximate location, use independent model to store those
      entities for better efficiency. (Since it's really trivia to visualize
      the location for these posts)

    - Better bounding box search logic. When a user slighly shift the viewpoint
      of the map, update the minimal amount of posts of area that is not
      intersected with previous viewing bounds, if any.

    - Try to improve the performance for proximitity fetch? Cache layer?
