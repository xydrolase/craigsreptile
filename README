CraigsReptile
==============

**CraigsReptile** is a discontinued project I made a few years back for
visualizing apartment listings on craigslist.

It runs on Google App Engine, but more than likely it will broke if you deploy
it now on GAE, considering the months elapsed since I last contributed to this
project.

Features
--------
* CragisReptile keeps track of the apartment listings on craigslist of the cities
to which the users subscribed. Each apartment's location on map is estimated
using Google's reverse geocoding API, and can appear as a color-coded icon on 
the map, with the color reflecting the price range.
* Users can use sliders to filter the apartments by listing dates and price.
* Users can also set up alert zones on map with certain filtering criteria, so 
that when a new apartment listing appears, the user is promptly notified by
email.
